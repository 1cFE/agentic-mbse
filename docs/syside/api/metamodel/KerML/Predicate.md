> <div>
> 
> A `Predicate` is a `Function` whose `result` `parameter` has type `Boolean` and multiplicity `1..1`.

Documentation from machine readable specification

Attributes defined in [`Predicate`](#syside.Predicate "syside.Predicate"):

Attributes defined in [`Function`](/v0.8.1/api/metamodel/KerML/Function.md "syside.Function"):

[`expressions`](/v0.8.1/api/metamodel/KerML/Function.md "syside.Function.expressions")

The `Expressions` that are `steps` in the calculation of the `result` of this `Function`.

The set of expressions that represent computational steps or parts of a system of equations within the Function.

[`is_model_level_evaluable`](/v0.8.1/api/metamodel/KerML/Function.md "syside.Function.is_model_level_evaluable")

Whether this `Function` can be used as the `function` of a model-level evaluable `InvocationExpression`. Certain `Functions` from the Kernel Functions Library are considered to have `isModelLevelEvaluable = true`. For all other `Functions` it is `false`.

**Note:** See the specification of the KerML concrete syntax notation for `Expressions` for an identification of which library `Functions` are model-level evaluable.

[`result`](/v0.8.1/api/metamodel/KerML/Function.md "syside.Function.result")

The object or value that is the result of evaluating the Function.

The `result` `parameter` of the `Function`, which is owned by the `Function` via a `ReturnParameterMembership`.

Attributes defined in [`Behavior`](/v0.8.1/api/metamodel/KerML/Behavior.md "syside.Behavior"):

[`parameters`](/v0.8.1/api/metamodel/KerML/Behavior.md "syside.Behavior.parameters")

The parameters of this `Behavior`, which are defined as its `directedFeatures`, whose values are passed into and/or out of a performance of the `Behavior`.

[`steps`](/v0.8.1/api/metamodel/KerML/Behavior.md "syside.Behavior.steps")

The `Steps` that make up this `Behavior`.

Attributes defined in [`Class`](/v0.8.1/api/metamodel/KerML/Class.md "syside.Class"):

Attributes defined in [`Type`](/v0.8.1/api/metamodel/KerML/Type.md "syside.Type"):

[`differencing_types`](/v0.8.1/api/metamodel/KerML/Type.md "syside.Type.differencing_types")

The interpretations of a `Type` with `differencingTypes` are asserted to be those of the first of those `Types`, but not including those of the remaining `Types`. For example, a `Classifier` might be the difference of a `Classifier` for people and another for people of a particular nationality, leaving people who are not of that nationality. Similarly, a feature of people might be the difference between a feature for their children and a `Classifier` for people of a particular sex, identifying their children not of that sex (because the interpretations of the children `Feature` that identify those of that sex are also interpretations of the `Classifier` for that sex).

[`directed_features`](/v0.8.1/api/metamodel/KerML/Type.md "syside.Type.directed_features")

[`feature_memberships`](/v0.8.1/api/metamodel/KerML/Type.md "syside.Type.feature_memberships")

The `FeatureMemberships` for `features` of this `Type`, which include all `ownedFeatureMemberships` and those `inheritedMemberships` that are `FeatureMemberships` (but does *not* include any `importedMemberships`).

[`inherited_features`](/v0.8.1/api/metamodel/KerML/Type.md "syside.Type.inherited_features")

All the `memberFeatures` of the `inheritedMemberships` of this `Type` that are `FeatureMemberships`.

[`inherited_memberships`](/v0.8.1/api/metamodel/KerML/Type.md "syside.Type.inherited_memberships")

All `Memberships` inherited by this `Type` via `Specialization` or `Conjugation`. These are included in the derived union for the `memberships` of the `Type`.

[`inputs`](/v0.8.1/api/metamodel/KerML/Type.md "syside.Type.inputs")

[`intersecting_types`](/v0.8.1/api/metamodel/KerML/Type.md "syside.Type.intersecting_types")

The interpretations of a `Type` with `intersectingTypes` are asserted to be those in common among the `intersectingTypes`, which are the `Types` derived from the `intersectingType` of the `ownedIntersectings` of this `Type`. For example, a `Classifier` might be an intersection of `Classifiers` for people of a particular sex and of a particular nationality. Similarly, a feature for people’s children of a particular sex might be the intersection of a `Feature` for their children and a `Classifier` for people of that sex (because the interpretations of the children `Feature` that identify those of that sex are also interpretations of the Classifier for that sex).

[`is_abstract`](/v0.8.1/api/metamodel/KerML/Type.md "syside.Type.is_abstract")

Indicates whether instances of this `Type` must also be instances of at least one of its specialized `Types`.

[`is_conjugated`](/v0.8.1/api/metamodel/KerML/Type.md "syside.Type.is_conjugated")

Indicates whether this `Type` has an `ownedConjugator`.

[`is_sufficient`](/v0.8.1/api/metamodel/KerML/Type.md "syside.Type.is_sufficient")

Whether all things that meet the classification conditions of this `Type` must be classified by the `Type`.

(A `Type` gives conditions that must be met by whatever it classifies, but when `isSufficient` is false, things may meet those conditions but still not be classified by the `Type`. For example, a Type `Car` that is not sufficient could require everything it classifies to have four wheels, but not all four wheeled things would classify as cars. However, if the `Type` `Car` were sufficient, it would classify all four-wheeled things.)

[`multiplicity`](/v0.8.1/api/metamodel/KerML/Type.md "syside.Type.multiplicity")

An `ownedMember` of this `Type` that is a `Multiplicity`, which constraints the cardinality of the `Type`. If there is no such `ownedMember`, then the cardinality of this `Type` is constrained by all the `Multiplicity` constraints applicable to any direct supertypes.

[`owned_end_features`](/v0.8.1/api/metamodel/KerML/Type.md "syside.Type.owned_end_features")

All `endFeatures` of this `Type` that are `ownedFeatures`.

[`owned_features`](/v0.8.1/api/metamodel/KerML/Type.md "syside.Type.owned_features")

The `ownedMemberFeatures` of the `ownedFeatureMemberships` of this `Type`.

[`owned_feature_memberships`](/v0.8.1/api/metamodel/KerML/Type.md "syside.Type.owned_feature_memberships")

The `ownedMemberships` of this `Type` that are `FeatureMemberships`, for which the `Type` is the `owningType`. Each such `FeatureMembership` identifies an `ownedFeature` of the `Type`.

[`owned_intersectings`](/v0.8.1/api/metamodel/KerML/Type.md "syside.Type.owned_intersectings")

The `ownedRelationships` of this `Type` that are `Intersectings`, have the `Type` as their `typeIntersected`.

The interpretations of a `Type` with `unioningTypes` are asserted to be the same as those of all the `unioningTypes` together, which are the `Types` derived from the `unioningType` of the `ownedUnionings` of this `Type`. For example, a `Classifier` for people might be the union of `Classifiers` for all the sexes. Similarly, a feature for people’s children might be the union of features dividing them in the same ways as people in general.

Attributes defined in [`Namespace`](/v0.8.1/api/metamodel/KerML/Namespace.md "syside.Namespace"):

[`members`](/v0.8.1/api/metamodel/KerML/Namespace.md "syside.Namespace.members")

An optional alternative name for the `Element` that is intended to be shorter or in some way more succinct than its primary `name`. It may act as a modeler-specified identifier for the `Element`, though it is then the responsibility of the modeler to maintain the uniqueness of this identifier within a model or relative to some other context.

[`is_implied_included`](/v0.8.1/api/metamodel/KerML/Element.md "syside.Element.is_implied_included")

Whether all necessary implied Relationships have been included in the `ownedRelationships` of this Element. This property may be true, even if there are not actually any `ownedRelationships` with `isImplied = true`, meaning that no such Relationships are actually implied for this Element. However, if it is false, then `ownedRelationships` may *not* contain any implied Relationships. That is, either *all* required implied Relationships must be included, or none of them.

[`owned_annotations`](/v0.8.1/api/metamodel/KerML/Element.md "syside.Element.owned_annotations")

The `ownedRelationships` of this `Element` that are `Annotations`, for which this `Element` is the `annotatedElement`.

The full ownership-qualified name of this `Element`, represented in a form that is valid according to the KerML textual concrete syntax for qualified names (including use of unrestricted name notation and escaped characters, as necessary). The `qualifiedName` is null if this `Element` has no `owningNamespace` or if there is not a complete ownership chain of named `Namespaces` from a root `Namespace` to this `Element`. If the `owningNamespace` has other `Elements` with the same name as this one, then the `qualifiedName` is null for all such `Elements` other than the first.

[`short_name`](/v0.8.1/api/metamodel/KerML/Element.md "syside.Element.short_name")

The short name to be used for this `Element` during name resolution within its `owningNamespace`. This is derived using the `effectiveShortName()` operation. By default, it is the same as the `declaredShortName`, but this is overridden for certain kinds of `Elements` to compute a `shortName` even when the `declaredName` is null.

[`textual_representations`](/v0.8.1/api/metamodel/KerML/Element.md "syside.Element.textual_representations")
